I'm a second-year student at UBC, studying **Business and Computer Science (BUCS)** with a minor in **Mathematics**. I'm interested in the intersection of finance and computer science, particularly in HFT (low-latency systems), algorithmic trading, and building predictive machine learning models to assess risk, volatility, and returns of securities. 

In the future, I hope to build a scalable AI education platform for high school and university students by creating simulated real-world experiences for hands-on learning.
